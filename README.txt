The only file needed to compile the game is the checkers.cpp file.

In order to execute the game call the executable name followed by a 
single argument in the form of a number that specifies the size of the board.

There are three different sizes of boards represented as followed:
  
  8x8 = 8
  10x10 = 10
  12x12 = 12
  
When playing the game enter the path of the desired checker through a
series of coordinates. The coordinate should be written as a letter 
representing the column followed by a number representing the row.
An example path for a checker is as follows.

A1 B2

Have fun and enjoy the game!
